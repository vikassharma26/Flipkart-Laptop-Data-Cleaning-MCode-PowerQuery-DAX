Flipkart Laptop Dataset Analysis Using Power BI
This repository contains the Power BI project where I analyzed and visualized a real-world dataset from Flipkart. The dataset was unstructured and messy, similar to what you'd find in e-commerce platforms. The project involved significant data cleaning, transformation, and deriving actionable insights through dynamic visualizations.

Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to handle unstructured datasets, clean and transform data using Power Query and DAX, and create insightful visualizations in Power BI.

Key Features
Data Cleaning and Transformation:

Extracted key product attributes like Brand, RAM, Processor, Storage, and Warranty from inconsistent product names using Power Query M code.
Handled missing or incorrect values and standardized data for accurate analysis.
DAX Calculations:

Created complex DAX measures to calculate Price Discounts, Warranty Info, and Ratings.
Used DAX to filter and showcase top laptops based on different criteria.
Interactive Visuals:

Brand with Highest Warranty: Highlighting brands with the maximum warranty.
Brands with Highest Ratings: Visualizing top brands based on the sum of ratings and average stars.
Top Laptops by Ratings: Showcasing the top 5 laptops with the highest average stars.
Top Laptops by Discounts: Top 5 laptops with the highest discounts.
Technologies Used
Power BI for data visualization and reporting.
Power Query (M language) for data transformation.
DAX for calculated measures and data insights.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from Flipkart, focusing on laptops, their features, ratings, and pricing.

Challenges Faced
Dealing with inconsistent product names to extract key product features like Brand, RAM, Processor, etc.
Handling missing values, such as "Not Available" warranty information.
Creating meaningful insights from a dataset with no fixed patterns and messy data.
How to Access the Report
